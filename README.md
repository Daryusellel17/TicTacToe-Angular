# TicTacToe in **Angular + Ionic**
Project started for fun. It's literally tic tac toe for mobile phones.

## How the game works
- The starting player (**X**) will choose a slot on the board. Once clicked, an icon will appear indicating that the player has chosen the slot.
- X's turn will end and O's turn will begin. They will also have to choose a slot.
- The game continues until one of the two players has *a row of 3 slots*. This means that one player has won.
- If neither of the players have won the game and there are no slots left on the board, the game will end in a **Draw**.
- There will also be a ***Reset*** button available to reset the game board at any time.

We all know how to play tic tac toe, there was no need for me to write the wall of text above.
